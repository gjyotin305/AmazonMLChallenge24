## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gjyotin305/AmazonMLChallenge24.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd AmazonMLChallenge24
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the image prediction and processing pipeline:

1. Ensure you have the dataset available at the specified paths or adjust the paths in the script accordingly.

2. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python eval.py
    ```

   This script will process images and output predictions as defined in the code.

3. For specific tasks or stages, you can modify and execute scripts located in the `scripts` folder.

## Data

The project uses images and related data for training and testing. Ensure that you have the dataset in the following directory structure:

- `../dataset/`: Contains CSV files and other metadata.
- `/data/.jyotin/AmazonMLChallenge24/student_resource 3/images_train/`: Contains training images.

## Model

The project utilizes the `LlavaNextForConditionalGeneration` model from Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers library. The model is fine-tuned for the specific task of extracting and analyzing numerical information from images.

- **Model Name**: `llava-hf/llava-v1.6-mistral-7b-hf`
- **Processor**: `LlavaNextProcessor`

## Results

Results of the predictions and analyses are printed to the console. Modify the script to save results to files or visualize them as needed.
